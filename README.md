# tamabot

<h2> about </h2>
tamabot is a discord bot, that is experimental and newly made.

my goal is to give it as many features as possible such as currency system, music player, image generation, etc. for fun.
(similar to dankmemer bot and other multipurpose bots)

<h2> changelog </h2>
Version 0.2.6 Patch Notes:

- Added new commands: mute, unmute, poll

- Added automod, it removes any message with 'carl wheezer'

- Added error handling.

- Added bot reactions! The bot now reacts to certain messages.

- Added new bot messages.

- The commands 'kick' and 'ban' will work now if the user's DMs are closed. #futureproof


<h2> next update? </h2>
We are currently working on v0.3.0 and v0.3.1 where we are dealing with technical futureproofing and database implementation. After that, hopefully, we can start making snapshots for the economy features.
