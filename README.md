# tamabot

<h2> about </h2>
tamabot is a discord bot, that is experimental and newly made.

my goal is to give it as many features as possible such as currency system, music player, image generation, etc. for fun.
(similar to dankmemer bot and other multipurpose bots)

<h2> updates </h2>
UPDATE 0.2.2 has been added to the bot!

The bot is now hosted online, so it will be up indefinitely. Hopefully. Lol.

Downtime will happen as we are hosting it for FREE. Do not worry, it should get back up in a few minutes or so.

<h2> next update? </h2>
The next update will be 0.2.3 which will introduce embeds and more commands, to be out by this week.

<h2> roadmap </h2>
