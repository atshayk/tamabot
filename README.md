# tamabot

<h1> !!! security notice </h1>
Highly advised to not execute any code on your machine.

As of July 2024, Github's Dependabot has identified 19 different vulnerabilities associated with the code with high severity.

This is due to old and outdated code from 2021.

I will fix these issues when I resume development of the bot.

Please keep this in mind if you wish to execute the program.

I'm not liable for any damages or harm done to any machine, as the intention of the bot is not to infect or enable attackers, but rather plain simple fun.

Thank you for reading, and stay safe.

<h2> about </h2>
"tamabot" is a discord bot, which chats and executes in-built commands.

It is intended for good fun with friends in Discord servers and operated with close to zero downtime.

<h2> goal </h2>
To give it as many features as possible such as currency system, music player, image generation, etc. for fun.
(similar to dankmemer bot and other multipurpose bots)

<h2> changelog </h2>
17.07.2024 - The bot is currently in version alpha 3 and has not had any active development lately. i'm busy with other projects!

<h2> Technical Details </h2>
The bot was developed in Python using Pycord library which accessed the Discord API.

I deployed the bot on the Repl.it platform with Heroku, creating a web server file that used a module called Flask.

The bot required to be pinged every 10 or so minutes, so I solved the issue by using UptimeRobot which monitored the bot and notified me whenever it was experiencing downtime.

The bot had an uptime of about 98% which was pretty good, and rarely gave any issues.
