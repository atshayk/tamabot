# tamabot

<h2> about </h2>
tamabot is a discord bot, that is experimental and newly made.

my goal is to give it as many features as possible such as currency system, music player, image generation, etc. for fun.
(similar to dankmemer bot and other multipurpose bots)

<h2> changelog </h2>
Version 0.2.6 Patch Notes:

- Added new commands: mute, unmute, poll

- Added automod, it removes any message with 'carl wheezer'

- Added error handling.

- Added bot reactions! The bot now reacts to certain messages.

- Added new bot messages.

- The commands 'kick' and 'ban' will work now if the user's DMs are closed. #futureproof


<h2> next update? </h2>
Hi! Sorry for no show.

Bot development has been in hiatus due to college coursework.

The next update will be 0.3.0. It will be focusing on database implementation and cleaning up the code to make development easier for us.
Currently in 0.2.6, it's very messy despite the limited functionality of the bot.
We'll also optimise and improve on existing features like moderation commands.

In 0.4, we will make economy snapshots and introduce manyyy new features.

And in 0.5, hopefully we can introduce image/gif generation.
